# Pathfinding Visualizer (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra with Animation)

An **interactive pathfinding visualizer** built in JavaFX, designed to help learners understand and compare classic search algorithms in a dynamic, visual environment.

## Overview

This project allows users to explore **DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra algorithms** through real-time animations on a customizable grid. Users can set start and end points, place obstacles or weighted nodes, and watch the algorithms traverse the grid step by step.

Key features include:

- **Interactive grid editor**: Place start/end points and obstacles with customizable weights.  
- **Algorithm animation**: Visual step-by-step execution of DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra.  
- **Time complexity tracking**: Real-time charts showing visited nodes over time.  
- **Path visualization**: Highlights the final path in yellow for easy understanding.  
- **Algorithm comparison**: Compare execution times using integrated bar charts.  
- **Info panel**: Displays algorithm name, visited nodes, path length, elapsed time, and current status.  

## Educational Purpose

This tool is designed for providing a hands-on way to understand:

- Graph traversal and shortest path algorithms  
- Algorithm efficiency and time complexity  
- Impact of weighted nodes on pathfinding  

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Java  
- **Framework**: JavaFX for GUI and animation  
- **Data Structures**: Stack, Queue, PriorityQueue  
- **Visualization**: Real-time charts using JavaFX `LineChart` and `BarChart`  
- **Animations**: JavaFX `Timeline` and `KeyFrame` for smooth algorithm playback
